1. how to resolve human relationship problems immediately
: Try to be less sensitive to how others think about you, even though they are your bosses.
: Don't take care of others business. Just do your job. How to evaluate your job is their job, not your job.
: If your boss is not satisfied with your job and you feel bad about it, the truth is that you make it as an excuse that you can't do your job well. You say that I can't do it because my boss is a bad guy. But actually you use him as an excuse for your bad work.
: Make a clear distinction between your job and others' one. Don't be irritated and, at the same time, don't interrupt! Then all the problems will go away. That's the Key!

2. But how to actually untie the complex knot of human relationship?
: Just cut it with a knife like Gordias(refer to the Gordian Knot)

3. What is freedom?
: It is to get "hatred" from others. If you are going to get hatred from nobody, you will get a lot of stress and probably have to lie to somebody. And, hence, you can never have freedom.
: Freedom is like a reward given by ignoring others' evaluation about you, others hatred to you and failing to get recognition from others. You can't get the reward unless you dare those.
: Once again, hatred to you from others is their job, not your job. Don't try to intervene it.
